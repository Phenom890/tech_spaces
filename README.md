This project is a result of a youtube tutorial(Study buddy) from Dennis Ivy.
I used his templates for the project and his idea but just extended it into something more like stack overflow or reddit, something like that.
This is project is called Tech Spaces because I created it to serve as a space for Kwmame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology(KNUST) students ask questions and get the answers from their colleagues,
the answers are voted by others just like Stack Overflow, so the answer with the most upvotes are top and vice versa.
Anyone can view the questions asked by the students, but to be able to ask or answer a quesiton, you need an account.
To start, you create an account using the login link on the navbar.
Ask your question and fill in the relevant fields in the questionnaire and send.
Students interested in the question will view it and answer it if they can, and it wiil be voted(upvoted or downvoted) by the fellow students who view the question based on their opinion if it is correct.
I would really welcome new ideas to extend and enhance this project, so please If anyone has a good idea they can just make a pull request and I will check it out and merge it.
If you notice any bugs in the code please create an issue and i will review it.
Thanks
